Week 7 Short answers 
Part 1 - Short answer questions.

Put the answers to these questions in a README file in your homework repo.

Reminder: Answering the questions is mandatory for a passing grade, but the accuracy of your answers won’t be graded. Your mentor will give you feedback if you answer them incorrectly.

Try answering the questions without looking up the answers in the content. Trying to recall the answers from memory and writing in your own words is a really effective technique to improve your memory. If you get stuck, review the content and write the answer in your own words. The only guaranteed way to get these wrong is to not answer them!
